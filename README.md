# ASSIGNMENT - CUSTOMER PROJECT - THOUGH COOKIE
_Studying "Front End Developer" at Medieinstituet_
## WHAT I USED
Built with: 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this assignment I got four design images of how the webpage should look like in desktop mode. So I had to figure out the design for mobile and tablet by myself. I also got a brief about the page:

- This is an one-pager. 
- It should be responsive. 
- Color codes: Green 100%, 0%, 78%, 0%. Yellow 0%, 5%, 79%, 0%. Cancel-button in the formular 263°, 100%, 73%.
- Fonts: Jockey One and Roboto Condensed.
- When the pointer is hovering over the lettuce image, the arrow will move down a bit in a snappy way. Not too fast, not too slow. 
- A dynamic heading effect on "Tahini, chickpeas, drizzle", one word over another.
- A moving effect on the hamburger menu.
- When the menu is open, the hamburger should turn into a closing icon: "X". 
- When clicking on "Explore menu", the food-page will appear.
- No need for JavaScript. Only HTML and CSS/SASS.
- You don't have to be able to close the cookie-bar. 
- You should only be able to close the menu on the closing icon, not when pressing a menu link. 

### Learning objectives & assessment
- Use semantic HTML.
- Validation of HTML and CSS.
- Accessability.
- Basics in CSS and SASS.
- The planning of design/layout. 
- Create lists, grid, flex and menues.
- Responsiveness, Media Queries. 
- Images, including accessability, SEO and best practice. 
- Link to another section of the page. 
- Text effects.
- Special fonts. 
- Icons. 
- Positioning and stacking. 
- Cookies. 
- Formular. 
- Naming, structured and consistent CSS.

### Little about the process and thoughts
The positioning was very tricky at the beginning. Trial and error. Even though the design isn't top notch, I'm proud of what I've been able to create from a given design. If that's what the customer wants, well, here you go! 
> I also added a moving effect to the Thaini-heading for some extra dynamic effect. 

> In mobile mode, I made the food images on page 2 to be scrollable horizontally.

> It's responsive down to 320px.
